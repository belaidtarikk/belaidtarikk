# Hi there, I'm Tarik 👋 Welcome to my GitHub profile!

🎓 I'm a graduated Software Engineer from ENSA Marrakech, passionate about **Web Engineering**, **Cloud Computing**, and **Search Technologies**.

💻 I specialize in building **full-stack applications** using **Spring Boot** and **Angular**, with a strong focus on **clean architecture** and **performance optimization**.

🧠 I'm deeply interested in **scalable systems**, particularly in the fields of **search engines**, **information retrieval**, and **distributed architectures**.

🧪 I enjoy experimenting with **AI/ML models** on platforms like **Kaggle**, especially for **classification** and **smart filtering** tasks.

🌍 I love contributing to **open-source projects** and exchanging ideas on topics ranging from software architecture to real-world development strategies.

📚 I'm always eager to **teach**, **learn**, and **share knowledge**—whether it's backend logic, front-end design tips, or clean code practices.
